# FLUTTER

## Download

https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos

download the archive in your ~/Downloads folder.

## Install Flutter
On a Mac tilde character "~" is `Option+n` and it is a shortcut
for the $HOME directory.

- create a tools directory:
    `mkdir ~/tools`
-  unzip the archive and extract the content to ~tools
    `unzip -o -q flutter_macos_1.22.6-stable.zip -d ~/tools/`
- check if flutter folder has been extracted in ~/tools
    `ls -lah ~/tools`
- change directory to $HOME (which is ~)
    `cd`
- append to the PATH so that MacOS can find the flutter binary
    `echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$PWD/tools/flutter/bin"' >> .zshrc`
    note:
    - zsh is supposed to be the default shell on MacOS in 2021
    - `>> .zshrc`  means append at the end of the file .zshrc which contains configuration for zsh
    - $PATH contains previous content of variable PATH
    - $PWD means path to working directory (current directory you are in)
- make sure you apply new config
    `source .zshrc`
- check if binary has been added, should give you the path to flutter binary
    `which flutter`
- check your flutter installation
    `flutter doctor`
